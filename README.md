# AI Daily Brief – 10 Week Resolution

This repository tracks my 10-week challenge to get current on modern AI, LLMs, and AI-enabled application development.

## Goals
- Ship something usable every week
- Prefer deployment over polish
- Reuse code, prompts, and context across weeks
- End with a deployed AI-powered application

## Weekly Breakdown
- Week 1: Resolution Tracker (PWA)
- Week 2: Model Topography
- Week 3: Deep Research Sprint
- Week 4: Data Analysis Project
- Week 5: Visual Reasoning Project
- Week 6: Information Pipeline
- Week 7: Automation #1
- Week 8: Automation #2
- Week 9: Context Engineering
- Week 10: AI-Powered Build

## Tooling Philosophy
- Cursor is the source of truth for all code
- AI tools accelerate, but do not own, the code
- Simple first, extensible later

## Deployment Philosophy
- Ship early
- Public URLs where possible
- Optimize for learning velocity
