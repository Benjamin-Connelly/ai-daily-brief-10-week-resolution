# Week 2 – Model Topography

## Objective
Build a practical decision framework for when to use ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini (AI Studio), based on repeatable tests.

## Definition of Done
- Run the same test suite through 3 models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Score outputs using a consistent rubric
- Produce:
  - a comparison table
  - rules of thumb (when to use which)
  - a short "default workflow" for Weeks 3–10

## Models in scope
- ChatGPT (Plus)
- Claude (Paid)
- Gemini via Google AI Studio (Free)

## Non-goals
- No app features
- No automation
- No fine-tuning

## Status
Scaffold complete. Test suite execution pending.
