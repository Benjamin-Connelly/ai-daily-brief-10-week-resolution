# Scoring Rubric (Week 2)

Score each model output 1–5 per category (5 = best).

## Categories
1. Correctness (facts, logic, no hallucination)
2. Completeness (covers requirements)
3. Clarity (readable, structured, actionable)
4. Follow-instructions (matches constraints exactly)
5. Efficiency (minimal fluff, good prioritization)
6. Safety/Security (no risky guidance; sane defaults)
7. Code Quality (if code is involved: compiles, idiomatic, maintainable)

## Notes
- Record failures and "gotchas" explicitly.
- Prefer concrete examples over opinions.
